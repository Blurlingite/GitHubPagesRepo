          Jotto is a word guessing app. Every guess is added to a table and shows you
          how many letters it has in common with the secret word. I made 2 versions of
          this app, one using Redux and the other using Hooks & Context,
          These apps were made as part of a Udemy course and were my introduction to 
          testing in React. However, I did add a challenge for myself by adding Typescript to them as well.

            The Player(s) are able to move within a certain range of the screen
            and can fire a laser with a 1 second cool down before they can fire
            again. I created a spawn manager that controls how the enemies are
            spawned. It uses a coroutine so that the game will wait a certain
            amount of seconds (3 seconds) and then spawn another enemy. The
            enemy can fire 2 lasers at once as shown by my enemyLaser
            GameObject. The enemy's lasers also have a cool down that is
            determined by my _canFire variable. The _laserPrefab used in
            enemyLaser is actually a container that holds 2 laser objects. This
            gives the enemy an edge because a direct hit means the Player will
            lose 2 lives. Yikes! They mean business! (The business of misery)

                In my player script, the CalculateMovement() method tells the
                player how to move and sets the boundary that causes the player
                to switch to the opposite side.
                <br />
                <br />
                On line 233, I assign a variable Unity's horizontal axis from
                it's Input Manager. This Input Manager assigns keys of my
                choosing to it so I can use them to move along the horizontal
                axis (left/right). I chose to use the left and right arrow keys.
                The same thing happens on line 235 but with the vertical axis
                and the up & down arrrow keys instead (to move up/down). I use
                the horizontal and vertical variables
                <br />
                <br />
                On line 237, the direction variable controls our direction of
                travel. It uses the horizontal variable as the x value and the
                vertical variable as the y value in this Vector3(x,y,z) to allow
                us to move the player both horizontally and vertically using the
                arrow keys. We don't need the z axis in this 2D game so we pass
                in 0.
                <br />
                <br />
                "_speed" is a global variable that controls how fast the player
                moves and when we combine it with the Vector3 that controls the
                player's horizontal and vertical axes, it will apply that speed
                when you press the arrow keys. We also multiply this by
                Time.deltaTime so the player moves in real time and not game run
                time (which would be so fast you probably wouldn't see it move).
                <br />
                <br />
                On line 241, I use Mathf.Clamp() to restrict the y position of
                the player to -3.8f and 0. Which stops the player from moving
                below the bottom of the screen & above the middle of the screen.
                <br />
                <br />
                On lines 243-247, I make the player warp to the opposite side of
                the screen (horizontally). I use an if-else if statement to
                check if the player is at the far left or right(which I
                determined to be -10.46 & +10.46 respectively). If they are then
                I just reassign the position.

                The player script's FireLaser() allows the player to shoot a
                laser. The _canFire float holds how much time you must wait
                before another laser can be shot. It is calculated by taking the
                current time the game has been running and adding my _fireRate
                float (set to 0.15 seconds) When a Triple Shot power up is
                collected, the _isTripleShotActive bool is changed to true,
                which then instantiates my triple shot prefab of 3 lasers when
                we go to fire a laser.
              </p>

              <br />
              <br />

              <p>
                In this if statement we see we can only fire a laser if
                Time.time is greater than _canFire. So if The game was running
                for 2.00 seconds and _canFire was calculated to be 2.15 (2.00
                game time + 0.15 from _fireRate) we can't fire a laser until the
                game has been running for at least 2.16 seconds.

                I used a coroutine to have an enemy spawn every 3 seconds. I use
                the _stopSpawning bool to stop enemies from spawning when the
                game has ended. When the game ends, (because the player has
                died), I change _stopSpawning to true which will stop lines

              The enemy attacks are very similar to the player's except that
              the rate at which they fire is randomized, so the player can't
              memorize the enemy's attack pattern.

              On line 110, I am accessing an array of audio sources that are
              on the enemy object. I have 2 as shown below: 1 for the
              enemy's explosion sound and the other for it's laser sound.

              That prefab I assigned is an object that holds 2 of the laser
              objects (also used by the player), giving the enemy a dual
              laser to shoot.

                  Since this is a 2D game, I am using Unity's OnTriggerEnter2D()
                  method to detect & react to collisions. I used that instead of
                  OnCollisionEnter2D() because the power up will serve as a
                  trigger. Meaning, I don't want to apply a force on the player
                  when the power up collides with it (if it did that, the power
                  up would push the player back as if the power up damages the
                  player when they collect it).
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  On line 47, a switch statement is used to change one of the
                  player's bools depending on the incoming powerupID (which is
                  determined by which power up the player collected).

                  When the player's laser collides with an object, the laser is
                  destroyed first (line 156)the enemy's speed is set to 0 to
                  stop it from moving while destroyed(line 159) the enemy's
                  collider is destroyed (line 162), then we destroy the enemy
                  object (line 167). The order of destruction is important
                  because if we destroyed the enemy object first, this code is
                  destroyed with it(because it is attached to the enemy object
                  with the Enemy.cs script) and won't run.

                  <br />
                  On line 151, I am checking to see if the laser that collided
                  with the enemy is an enemy laser. If it is, do nothing so that
                  other enemies can't destroy this enemy.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  On line 167, I passed in the amount of time to wait as the
                  second argument before destroying the enemy object. This is to
                  give the explosion animation and sound effect time to play
                  before the enemy is destroyed.

                  When we have 1 life left, the left engine is damaged. The
                  damaged right and left engines are actually child objects to

                  depending on how many lives the player has.
